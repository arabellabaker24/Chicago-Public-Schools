      <h1>Chicago Public Schools Report Card</h1>
      <p>The Chicago Public Schools District releases an annual report detailing the student's accomplishments and performance of individual schools in Chicago. Although the reports are released annually, the reports now just show a couple of highlights about the entire performance of the district instead of a whole dataset detailing each school. The last available full report is from the 2011-2012 school year. 

        In these academic report cards, various topics are covered about each school including the schools, academic performance, safety level, location, and parent involvement among many others. The report card is a tool that is utilized by parents, administrators, and the community to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the school to determine the best ways to improve the school for the children.

        The data that follows demonstrates that there is a correlation between â€¦
        
        It is crucial to understand this data and these relationships because education is the most important thing for children and we can help them get the most out of their education by putting the necessary resources in their schools.

      <h4>Our Data Journey:</h4>
      <p>We did lots of different data cleansing and editing in order to get our data in a readable format. First and foremost we deleted over 20 different columns because they provided data that was very unncessary for our project. There was also many instances when NAN was in our dataset instead of a number. </p>
